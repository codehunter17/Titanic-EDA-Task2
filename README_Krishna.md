# Titanic Dataset - Task 2 EDA (By Krishna Kant)

## About this Project:
I am doing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic Dataset. This is part of my Data Science / ML learning.

## What I did in this task:
- Checked dataset info and missing values
- Looked at basic statistics like mean, median
- Created histograms to see distributions
- Used boxplots to find outliers
- Plotted correlation heatmap to see relationships between numeric columns
- Made a scatter plot of Age vs Fare vs Survived using Plotly
